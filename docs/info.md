## How it works

This is a simple AND gate, In0 and In1 are the two inputs, Out0 is the output.

## How to test

Connect two input signals to In0 and In1, then test the truth table of the output Out0 to confirm it is the output of an AND gate

## External hardware

Any output that takes either a High or Low Signal, like an LED.
